// We copy whichever of them is smaller to the target location and increment the
// corresponding current position. We keep doing this until we finish one of the arrays,
// after which the elements of the other array can just be copied over. The following
// shows the code for the merge operation. One thing to note is that, since the merge
// will be used for a mergesort, it presumes both the input arrays to be the same array
// with different indexes and the target arrays to have the same size. The source has
// three indexes: start, mid, and end. It is assumed that the source parts are residing
// side by side in the source array. The variable start points to the start of the first
// part. The integer mid stores the index of the start of the second part and also acts as
// the end of the first part, as the parts are contiguous. Finally, the end variable stores
// the end of the second array:

// 2. Mergesort the parts.

// base case:

        }

//         For any array of size bigger than 1, divide the array into two halvesâ€“start to mid
// and mid to end. Then merge-sort them separately, and then merge the two sorted
// subarrays to a combined sorted array in tempArray, which is an auxiliary space that
// we are using:
        int mid = (start + end)/2;

//         Finally, copy the contents of tempArray to sourceArray so that the source is
// now sorted:
