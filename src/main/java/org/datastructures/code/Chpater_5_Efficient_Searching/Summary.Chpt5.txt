In this chapter, we saw how to do an efficient search in an ordered array. This search is
called a binary search. You also learned some methods of obtaining an ordered array
out of an unordered one. This process is called sorting. We saw three basic algorithms
of sorting. Although they are not particularly efficient, they are simple to understand
the concept. You also learned how to convert a recursive algorithm to a non-recursive
one that uses a loop.
